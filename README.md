# Custom Ruby Methods

The idea is that I want to break down Ruby methods that I use a lot to their simplest form so I can customize them as needed.

This repo will have custom ruby methods that can be modified by adding more to them or changing their functionalities.

I have few in mind for now.

----
## Methods

1. [custom_compact](https://github.com/siralomarahmed/custom-ruby-methods/blob/master/methods/custom_compact.rb)

This method will emulate the same functionality of the compact method. You can use it if you need to remove nil values from an array.

----
2. [custom_count](https://github.com/siralomarahmed/custom-ruby-methods/blob/master/methods/custom_count.rb)

This method will emulate the same functionality of the count method. You can use it to return the number of elements.
